# RISC-V M-Extension Files

* This directory contains some (stale?) tests for picorv32 div/mul used for M-type.
* `div_opt_testbench.tlv` is to test division module independently (works directly with Makerchip).
* `mul_opt_testbench.tlv` is to test multiplication module independently (works directly with Makerchip).
* `muldiv_tlv_macro.tlv` is the macro code to be used as is in WARP-V as is and can also be used to test both modules in one file (works directly with Makerchip).
